            "description": "<font size='3'><span style='font-family: Arial;'>The 'Marine Plan Areas' are 10 sub-areas of the 'English inshore and offshore  marine planning regions'. The marine plan authority (the Secretary of State in  England) is responsible for preparing marine plans for these 10 plan areas with  responsibility for plan development delegated to The Marine Management  Organisation. The MMO may wish to make specific local modifications to  boundaries if it is perceived that the proposed boundaries could lead to  unnecessary difficulties with either the implementation of the Marine Policy  Statement or the integration with planning and management mechanisms on land.  The boundaries will be subject to stakeholder consultation through the Statement  of Public Participation - a process undertaken at the start of plan making.<br /><br />Using bio-geographical regions and administrative boundaries, English waters  were divided into a number of offshore and inshore plan areas. The inshore areas  extend to the 12-mile limit and the offshore areas extend from the territorial  sea limit to the UK Renewable Energy Zone. Modifications of the marine plan  areas were made in July 2010 following a public consultation (led bt Defra in  October 2009). Further modifications by the MMO are as follows: October 2010: to  align the landward boundary with Ordnance Surveys Mean High Water (springs)  definition (OS Boundary Line, May 2010). July 2012: to align the outer offshore  boundary with the UK Renewable Energy Zone, as per the guidance ourlined in the  Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. Public response to consultation on the draft  Marine Bill indicated that plan areas should be designated on bio-geographical  regions rather than political boundaries and so plan boundaries are based on the  regional reporting areas laid out in Charting Progress, Water Framework  Directive regions, ICES proposed eco-regions, Natural England's Marine Natural  Areas and Sea Fisheries Committee/IFCA regions. The 12-mile limit acts as the  boundary between inshore and offshore plan areas. Planning areas are constrained  by the borders with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Vector data  delineating the national borders, the 12-mile limit and the Charting Progress  regions were merged to generate the regional boundaries.<br /></span></font>",

The data is modeled in  part as well as utilising data from AIS (Automatic Identification System)  systems. These systems use VHF signals and shows the location and type of  vessel. VHF signals are limited by line of sight range due to the curvature of  the Earth which means this data is limited to being collected within 30 nautical  miles of any receiver. Anatec have receivers collecting data along the coast and  on oil and gas platforms meaning areas outside these are modeled. The modeled  information that Anatec use is formed of estimates using known ship routing  frequencies which ANATEC collect in their 'Ship Routes' database. The data in  the inshore and around oil and gas infrastructure (where ANATEC have AIS  receivers logging traffic) will be far more reliable than offshore locations  which will be purely estimates based on common ship routing. When calculating  ship density, the movements of 'non-routine traffic' such as fishing vessels, as  military vessels, tugs, dredgers and recreational craft are excluded. The data  represents the best available annual dataset for shipping held by Anatec at time  of commissioning, however shipping data is dynamic and its reliability will tend  to reduce over time. Anatec advises that data is valid for a period of 12 months  from commissioning. This data should be viewed alongside policy PS2 in the Draft  East Inshore and East Offshore marine plans.</span></font>",

Layers are for Static Gear and vessels of less than 12m length only. The information in these layers was derived from the annual data call submitted to the EU Data Collection Framework, and subsequently the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). While STECF assesses amalgamated European fisheries data, this map specifically focuses on the MMO's UK submission. Verification of inshore fishing reports can be difficult and while positional accuracy may be lacking, this is the best available data for the inshore fleet.",

Parish and Town Councils can also declare LNRs but they must have the powers to do so delegated to them by a principal local authority. LNRs are for people and wildlife. They are places with wildlife or geological features that are of special interest locally. They offer people opportunities to study or learn about nature or simply to enjoy it. They range from windswept coastal headlands, ancient woodlands and flower-rich meadows to former inner city railways, long abandoned landfill sites and industrial areas now re-colonised by wildlife. They are an impressive natural resource which makes an important contribution to England's biodiversity.  This national dataset is 'indicative' not 'definitive'. Definitive information can only be provided by individual local authorities and you should refer directly to their information for all purposes that require the most up to date and complete dataset.<div><br /></div><div>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/acdf4a9e-a115-41fb-bbe9-603c819aa7f7/local-nature-reserves-england' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>data.gov.uk</a>.</div>",

They protect nationally important marine wildlife, habitats, geology and geomorphology. Sites were selected in English inshore and offshore waters to protect not just rare and threatened marine wildlife and habitats, but also the range of biodiversity across biogeographic regions. The Highly Protected Marine Areas project followed the recommendations of the Benyon review in 2022 and sites were selected to achieve the full recovery of the marine ecosystem within the site, including the biotic and abiotic elements of the seabed, water column and surface of the sea.<br /><br />This data layer is composed of boundaries for both Marine Conservation Zones and Highly Protected Marine Areas. These boundary polygons were developed by Natural England and JNCC through a process which involved a number of different stages including the gathering and assessment of evidence, site proposals, consultations and refining of boundaries before final site designation. The boundaries have been drawn using the wide variety of evidence which went into this process. Where inshore sites follow the shoreline, they are usually drawn to follow OS Mastermap MHW.<br /></p><p>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/80c075c3-1880-44a0-bffc-69e20f307c21/marine-conservation-zones-england' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>data.gov.uk</a>.</p>",

Carbon abatement is the reduction in carbon dioxide presently being released to the atmosphere from the environment when land use and management are in conflict with the best carbon outcome. This layer compliments the carbon sequestration map and shows where different types of actions can be taken to maximise carbon storage and sequestration.  The approach here has been to highlight the worst areas of the country for carbon loss and abatement potential.  Where existing high quality semi natural habitat already exists there is likely to be opportunities to enhance carbon, but much of this is fine scale management decisions that a national data set cannot determine. So, a more precautionary approach has been applied that if a habitat presently exists on a site, land-use change has not been recommended. There will be places where an existing habitat could be enhanced or changed to another habitat to give carbon benefits. Many habitats have become degraded through management practices over time, such as drainage, which means it now sits in a lower carbon state &amp; is losing carbon and as such has abatement potential such as conversion from a dry grassland habitat with drainage to much wetter fenland habitat. In the worse cases some habitats in our current priority habitat classification system are degraded versions of other habitats and have the potential to move between habitats and so abating carbon. This layer has made a broad assessment of which land use may be changed to an appropriate higher carbon variant. In the case of very productive grassland and pasture we have assumed only a change to high carbon management practices where clear abatement gains are present. This is because high value agricultural land is a key non-renewable resource which is needed for food security. In addition, such land generates a good economic revenue for agricultural goods. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Full metadata can be viewed on </SPAN><A href=\"https://www.data.gov.uk:443/dataset/e321c3fa-e592-4d7e-a3b7-621ef79d2ec6/spatial-prioritisation-of-land-management-for-carbon-2023\" STYLE=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><SPAN>data.gov.uk</SPAN></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>",

At a local scale (e.g. 1:50 000). They are presented as a series of raster datasets for use in GIS Systems at a resolution of 25m2.

As well as soil being an excellent natural carbon sink, locking carbon away from the atmosphere and reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses produced soil carbon has a number of other excellent benefits. The amount of carbon stored within mineral soil depends upon the soil type, with clay rich and silt rich soils storing more carbon than sandy soils. Within peat soils, carbon storage operates by a different process. In a non-compromised or fully functional state peat soils are fully saturated with water for most of the year. This leads to the minimal decomposition of plant biomass, so soil carbon builds up faster than decomposition can occur, so no equilibrium is reached, to form a very carbon-rich layer of peat. However, if the peats are damaged so leading to drying out the soil microbial activity can re-start, and as the carbon is utilised by the soil microfauna, carbon dioxide and methane are then released to the atmosphere, changing a carbon sink that is sequestering carbon, into a source of greenhouse gas emissions. (UK Peatland Strategy 2018) . Natural England produced a report in 2021 reviewing this research and compiling different land use. approximate values in tons per hectare of carbon for a wide variety of habitats in England (Gregg et al 2021) see Carbon Storage and Sequestration by Habitat 2021 (NERR094).  </span></p><p><span>Full metadata can be found on </span><a href='https://www.data.gov.uk:443/dataset/e321c3fa-e592-4d7e-a3b7-621ef79d2ec6/spatial-prioritisation-of-land-management-for-carbon-2023' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'><span>data.gov.uk</span></a></p></div></div></div>",

The project uses a machine learning approach to image classification, developed under the Defra Living Maps project (SD1705 – Kilcoyne et al., 2017). The method first clusters homogeneous areas of habitat into segments, then assigns each segment to a defined list of habitat classes using Random Forest (a machine learning algorithm). The habitat probability map displays modelled likely broad habitat classifications, trained on field surveys and earth observation data from 2021 as well as historic data layers. <span style='background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial;'>This map is an output from Phase IV of the\nLiving England project, with future work in Phase V (2022-23) intending to\nstandardise the methodology and Phase VI (2023-24) to implement the agreed\nstandardised methods.</span><div><div><br /></div><div>The Living England habitat probability map will provide high-accuracy, spatially consistent data for a range of Defra policy delivery needs (e.g. 25YEP indicators and Environment Bill target reporting Natural capital accounting, Nature Strategy, ELM) as well as external users. As a probability map, it allows the extrapolation of data to areas that we do not have data. These data will also support better local and national decision making, policy development and evaluation, especially in areas where other forms of evidence are unavailable. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Process Description: A number of data layers are used to inform the model to provide a habitat probability map of England. The main sources layers are Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite data from the ESA Copericus programme. Additional datasets were incorporated into the model (as detailed below) to aid the segmentation and classification of specific habitat classes.  <br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div>Datasets used:<br /></div><div>Agri-Environment Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) Monitoring, British Geological Survey Bedrock Mapping 1:50k, Coastal Dune Geomatics Mapping Ground Truthing, Crop Map of England (RPA), Dark Peak Bog State Survey, Desktop Validation and Manual Points, EA Integrated Height Model 10m, EA Saltmarsh Zonation and Extent, Field Unit NEFU, Living England Collector App NEFU/EES, Long Term Monitoring Network (LTMN), Lowland Heathland Survey, National Forest Inventory (NFI), National Grassland Survey, National Plant Monitoring Scheme, NEFU Surveys, Northumberland Border Mires, OS Vector Map District , Priority Habitats Inventory (PHI) B Button, European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 , Space2 Eye Lens: Ainsdale NNR, Space2 Eye Lens: State of the Bog Bowland Survey, Space2 Eye Lens: State of the Bog Dark Peak Condition Survey, Space2 Eye Lens: State of the Bog  (MMU) Mountain Hare Habitat Survey Dark Peak, Uplands Inventory, West Pennines Designation NVC Survey,  Wetland Inventories, WorldClim - Global Climate Data</div></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/e207e1b3-72e2-4b6a-8aec-0c7b8bb9998c/living-england-habitat-map-phase-4' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>data.gov.uk</a>.<br /></div>",

The habitat network maps are developed around 4 distinct habitat components sets and include 4 distinct network zones where action may be undertaken to build greater ecological resilience. The different elements of the maps are described below.<div><br /></div><div><p>Habitat Components:</p><ul><li>The location of existing patches of a specific habitat for which the network is developed. This is termed the 'Primary habitat' e.g. lowland heathland. The main baseline data used for this is the Priority Habitat Inventories (PHI).</li><li>The location of additional habitat that naturally form mosaics with the primary habitat e.g. habitats that are most likely to form ecological mosaics possibly used by species associated with the primary habitat. This is termed the 'Associated habitat'. The main baseline data used for this is the PHI.</li><li>The locations where habitat creation or restoration is known to occur, this is primarily sites under relevant agri-environment options. This is termed the 'Habitat creation'.</li><li>Sites where data suggests small fragments of the primary habitat or degraded habitat exists and where restoration may be possible, this is primarily developed from information held within the current PHI. This is termed the 'Restorable habitat'.</li></ul><p></p><p>Network Zones:</p><ul><li>Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are more likely to be suitable for habitat re-creation for the particular habitat. These areas are primarily based on soils but in many cases has been refined by also using other data such as hydrology, altitude and proximity to the coast. This is termed the 'Network Enhancement Zone 1'.</li><li>Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are unlikely to be suitable for habitat re-creation but where other types of habitat may be created or land management may be enhanced including delivery of suitable Green Infrastructure. This is termed the 'Network Enhancement Zone 2'.</li><li>Land immediately adjoining existing habitat patches that are small or have excessive edge to area ratio where habitat creation is likely to help reduce the effects of habitat fragmentation. This is termed the 'Fragmentation Action Zone'.</li><li>Land within relatively close proximity to the Network Enhancement Zones 1 &amp; 2 that are more likely to be suitable for habitat creation for the particular habitat and identifying possible locations for connecting and linking up networks across a landscape. This is termed the 'Network Expansion Zone'</li></ul><div><div><br /></div><div>Note: For some habitat networks not all of the habitat components or all the action zones are identified either because the data does not exist or the habitat does not lend itself to identifying particular types of action. </div><div><br /></div><div>Further details are outlined in the <a href='https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.defra.gov.uk/Natural_England/Habitat_Species/Habitats/Habitat_Network_England_NE/Habitat_Networks_England_Version_2_Guidance.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Habitat Network Mapping Guidance document</a>. </div><div><br /></div><div>The Network boundary is drawn around the 4 habitat components using a variable buffering process with a generalised distance of 500m although 1km was used for Blanket Bog. As the boundary for each habitat network is tightly drawn around the existing patches of habitat this means that at a national scale the habitat network is composed of a series of smaller ‘networks’ that encapsulates one or more clusters of existing habitat patches. These may be considered as ‘network segments’. The Network Expansion Zone has been drawn around these segments to identify areas where additional action may be undertaken to build greater ecological resilience across the wider landscape.<br /></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/8e8071fd-46cc-41d3-900b-592c5949c0bd/habitat-networks-data-individual-england' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>data.gov.uk</a>.</div>",

Wood Pasture and Parkland is a Priority Habitat as listed in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) 2008.</span></p><p><span>Wood pastures and parkland are the products of historic land management systems and designed landscapes and represent a vegetation structure rather than a particular plant community. Typically, this structure consists of large, open-grown or high forest trees (often pollards) at various densities, in a matrix of grazed grassland, heathland and/or woodland floras.</span></p><p><strong>Why is it important that Natural England publishes this data</strong></p><p><span>Wood Pasture and Parkland (England) is a priority habitat as identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) and listed as being of principal importance for the purposes of conserving or enhancing biodiversity under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) act. Wood-pasture and parkland are mosaic habitats valued for their trees, especially veteran and ancient trees and the plants and animals that they support. Specialised and varied habitats within woodpasture and parkland provide a home for a wide range of species, many of which occur only in these habitats, particularly insects, lichens and fungi which depend on dead and decaying wood.</span></p><p><strong>Lineage</strong></p><p><span>The Wood Pasture and Parkland Inventory (WPPI) was initially created in 2011 under contract by Exegesis as a provisional inventory. The inventory was established by collating exsisting datasets, drawing on specialist knowledge, refering old maps and aerial photography. This inventory included data from: OS county series maps (Epoch 1 1843 - 1893, Epoch 2 1891 - 1912, Epoch 3 1904 - 1939, Epoch 4 1919 - 1943) and first and second edition UK perspective Aerial Photographs dated 1999 to 2009. Modern OS maps were used to created polygon boundaries and these boundaries were mapped to the OS Master Map framework.</span></p><p><span>This first inventory did not cover all England, subsequent inventories added missing counties e.g. Greater London by using the same techniques.</span></p><p><span>Data was added to the inventory in subsequent years based on expert feedback and survey work.</span></p><p><span>The inventory was updated in 2020 by collating data from the existing dataset, local record centers, local councils and other sources all verified by OS county series Epoch 1 - 4 maps and aerial photography. Parkland was defined as areas with a minimum of 3 trees, excluding boundary trees, which had less than 250 m between trees. Park extent was mapped to boundary features where park trees were less than 100 m from the boundary or the boundary included a large tree which was less than 250 m from a park tree.</span></p><p><span>Some areas of woodland were included where possible park trees were present. Some open areas and wooded areas were not removed as the precise extent of parkland habitat was difficult to determine from aerial photography.</span></p><p><span>Cemeteries and churchyards were excluded unless they were entirely within the park boundary.</span></p><p><span>The minimum mappable unit for the inventory was 0.25ha.

            "description": "One of the two datasets that make up the Priority River Habitat Map. Consists of rivers and streams that exhibit a high degree of naturalness. The naturalness classification used to map priority river habitat is based on recent work to review the river SSSI series. It evaluates four main components of habitat integrity: hydrological, physical, physico-chemical (water quality) and biological. An additional classification of the naturalness of headwaters (defined as streams with a catchment area of &lt;10km2 to coincide with WFD typology boundaries) uses land cover data as a surrogate for direct information on river habitat condition (information which is generally lacking on headwaters).                                                                                      Streams and rivers operating under natural processes, free from anthropogenic impact and with a characteristic and dynamic mosaic of small-scale habitats that supports characteristic species assemblages (including priority species), are the best and most sustainable expression of river ecosystems. Key elements are:\na natural flow regime; natural nutrient and sediment delivery regimes;\nminimal physical modifications to the channel, banks and riparian zone;  natural longitudinal and lateral hydrological and biological connectivity; an absence of non-native species; low intensity fishery activities.\nThese conditions provide the best defence against climate change, maximising the ability of riverine ecosystems to adapt to changing conditions. They also provide the most valuable and effective transitional links with other priority habitats, including lakes, mires and coastal habitats. In English rivers and streams, high levels of naturalness are rare.<div><br /></div><div>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/20019cdb-9fef-4024-81af-daf1d1b74762/priority-river-habitat-rivers' target='_blank'>data.gov.uk</a>.</div>",

            "description": "<p>This is a spatial dataset that describes the geographic extent and location of Habitat Networks for 18 priority habitats based primarily, but not exclusively, on the priority habitat inventory with additional data added in relation to habitat restoration-creation, restorable habitat, plus fragmentation action, and network enhancement and expansion zones. The maps are created following a standardised process that incorporates a range of data layers and identifies specific locations for a range of actions to help improve the ecological resilience for each of the habitats/habitat networks. This is the combined habitat network map.  This updated dataset replaces the two previous published layers 'Habitat Networks (Combined Habitats) (England)' and 'Habitat Networks (Combined Habitats) (England) Priority Restoration'</p>\n<p>The Habitat Networks (England) comprise a series of 23 individual habitat network maps for England plus a single 'Combined Habitat Networks Map' and 3 'Grouped Habitat Networks Map'.  The habitat network maps seek to apply the best evidence and principles and to use the best available nationally consistent spatial data. The habitat network maps are developed around 4 distinct habitat components sets and include 4 distinct network zones where action may be undertaken to build greater ecological resilience.  The different elements of the maps are described below:</p>\n<p>Habitat Components:\n</p><ul><li>The location of existing patches of a specific habitat for which the network is developed. This is termed the 'Primary habitat' e.g. lowland heathland.  The main baseline data used for this is the Priority Habitat Inventories (PHI).</li>\n<li>The location of additional habitat that naturally form mosaics with the primary habitat e.g. habitats that are most likely to form ecological mosaics possibly used by species associated with the primary habitat.  This is termed the 'Associated habitat'. The main baseline data used for this is the PHI.</li>\n<li>The locations where habitat creation or restoration is known to occur, this is primarily sites under relevant agri-environment options.  This is termed the 'Habitat creation'.</li>\n<li>Sites where data suggests small fragments of the primary habitat or degraded habitat exists and where restoration may be possible, this is primarily developed from information held within the current PHI. This is termed the 'Restorable habitat'.</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Network Zones:\n</p><ul><li>Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are more likely to be suitable for habitat re-creation for the particular habitat.  These areas are primarily based on soils but in many cases has been refined by also using other data such as hydrology, altitude and proximity to the coast. This is termed the 'Network Enhancement Zone 1'.</li>\n<li>Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are unlikely to be suitable for habitat re-creation but where other types of habitat may be created or land management may be enhanced including delivery of suitable Green Infrastructure. This is termed the 'Network Enhancement Zone 2'.</li>\n<li>Land immediately adjoining existing habitat patches that are small or have excessive edge to area ratio where habitat creation is likely to help reduce the effects of habitat fragmentation.  This is termed the 'Fragmentation Action Zone'.</li>\n<li>Land within relatively close proximity to  the Network Enhancement Zones 1 &amp; 2 that are more likely to be suitable for habitat creation for the particular habitat and identifying possible locations for connecting and linking up networks across a landscape.  This is termed the 'Network Expansion Zone'</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Further details are outlined in the <a href='https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.defra.gov.uk/Natural_England/Habitat_Species/Habitats/Habitat_Network_England_NE/Habitat_Networks_England_Version_2_Guidance.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Habitat Network Mapping Guidance document</a>. <br /></p>\n<p>Note:  For some habitat networks not all of the habitat components or all the action zones are identified either because the data does not exist or the habitat does not lend itself to identifying particular types of action.  Further details are outlined in the Habitat Network Mapping Guidance document.</p>\n<p>The Network boundary is drawn around the 4 habitat components using a variable buffering process with a generalised distance of 500m although 1km was used for Blanket Bog.  As the boundary for each habitat network is tightly drawn around the existing patches of habitat this means that at a national scale the habitat network is composed of a series of smaller 'networks' that encapsulates one or more clusters of existing habitat patches. These may be considered as 'network segments'. The Network Expansion Zone has been drawn around these segments to identify areas where additional action may be undertaken to build greater ecological resilience across the wider landscape.</p><p>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/0ef2ed26-2f04-4e0f-9493-ffbdbfaeb159/national-habitat-networks-england' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>data.gov.uk</a>.</p>",

            "description": "Verified sites of Open Mosaic Habitat.  Open mosaic habitats can be extremely diverse, including such wide ranging sites as railway sidings, quarries, former industrial works, slag heap, bings and brick pits. Brownfields with open mosaic habitats show evidence of previous disturbance, either through soil being removed or severely modified by previous use, or the addition of materials such as industrial spoil, with spatial variation developing across the site. The resultant variation allows for a mosaic of different habitats to be supported in close proximity. This habitat diversity can support rich assemblages of invertebrates, which has led to ‘open mosaic habitats on previously developed land’ being added to the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) as a Priority habitat listed on Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC Act).

            "description": "This is a spatial dataset that describes the geographic extent and location of areas that are listed under Limestone Pavement Orders. Limestone pavements are outcrops of limestone where the surface has been worn away by natural means over millennia. These rocks have the appearance of paving blocks, hence their name. Not only do they have geological interest, they also provide valuable habitats for wildlife. These habitats are threatened due to their removal for use in gardens and water features. Many limestone pavements have been designated as SSSIs which affords them some protection. In addition, Section 34 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 gave them additional protection via the creation of Limestone Pavement Orders, which made it a criminal offence to remove any part of the outcrop. The associated Limestone Pavement Priority Habitat is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitat in England. This is published separately. <div><br /></div><div>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/ff9f1088-4b07-4cab-88cf-838a8f421328/limestone-pavement-orders' target='_blank'>data.gov.uk</a>.</div>",

So these areas are the key opportunities for Natural England to integrate its delivery to achieve better outcomes. \nThe focus areas are the best picture NE have about where we need to concentrate effort in order to achieve our biodiversity, landscape, access, engagement and other land management objectives. They show where we currently focus more effort. \nThe focus areas are also the best overview we have of future priorities, but this is not yet a perfect picture. We expect this map to evolve. \nThe focus areas are not intended to represent the views or priorities of all the organisations which contribute to natural environment outcomes. However, we have taken account of other Defra partners‟ delivery programmes and also those of some other key partners. We want to have more discussions with partners and stakeholders to hear whether our local delivery offer makes sense in the context of what we are all jointly trying to achieve.\nThe focus areas are a broad guide as to where we anticipate focusing more effort in future; but it should not be interpreted too precisely. We can adjust boundaries locally as makes sense to our delivery programmes or customers. \nThe focus areas capture the majority of our geographically targeted work and especially where different programmes overlap, but each programme will continue to target some of its delivery elsewhere. \nWe want to focus proportionately more of our resource in focus areas and Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) over time, to maximise the benefits of our limited resource, and make a big difference in certain places, rather than not enough difference everywhere. \nThis is a strong steer, but not a moratorium on projects that are outside focus areas. Small scale investment outside the focus areas, which act as a catalyst or lever for others‟ investment, may be legitimate. \nWe have limited this approach to our terrestrial delivery at the moment. However, we have included many coastal stretches and have taken particular account of where the coast abuts a potential marine designation, to encourage integration with our marine work and to take account of the links with offshore processes such as sediment flow. While the current priority for marine work is the site designation process, we would aspire to develop marine spatial priorities over time.<div><br /></div><div>Full metadata can be viewed on <a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/c20a40c5-c975-43e1-9abd-d1257aa58432/natural-england-national-priority-focus-areas' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>data.gov.uk</a>.</div>",

This is the updated spatial dataset that describes the geographic extent and location of ancient woodland in England (excluding the Isles of Scilly). Ancient Woodland features will be approved county-by-county for publication throughout the first year of production until the data product coverage extends across England. Where available this dataset takes precedence over the Ancient Woodland – England dataset.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The update revises the inventory to address problems and gaps in the previous iteration. Technological advances mean that small ancient woodlands (0.25-2ha) are being represented within the inventory for the first time as well as wood pasture and parkland being represented as its own category.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The inventory identifies ancient woodland sites in England. Ancient woodland is identified by studying the presence or absence of woods from historic maps, information about the wood's name, shape, internal boundaries, location relative to other features, ground survey, and aerial photography. The information recorded about each wood and stored on the Inventory Database includes its grid reference, its area in hectares and how much is semi-natural or replanted. Prior to the digitisation of the boundaries, only paper maps depicting each ancient wood at 1:50 000 scale were available. Attribution statement: © Natural England 2024.

OS AC0000851168.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It includes Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), which retains a native tree and shrub cover; Plantation on Ancient Woodland Sites (PAWS), where the original tree cover has been felled and replaced by planting, often with conifers; Ancient Wood Pasture (AWPP), where the trees are managed in tandem with a long established tradition of grazing, characteristically with at least some veteran trees or shrubs or; Infilled Ancient Wood Pasture (IAWPP) which has become infilled with trees arising from planting or natural regeneration.</div></div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The AWI Update project will deliver an accurate inventory of the entirety of England’s ancient woodland resource, including those woods smaller than 2ha which are currently not mapped on the AWI.&nbsp; It will also ensure that the AWI is used and respected by planners, developers, land managers and all those who make and use spatial plans in England’s countryside.<br />&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Lineage</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The ancient woodland boundaries are digitised to OS MasterMap - assessed by licencing staff as suitable for OS Presumption to Publish process. However, the maps that Ancient Woodlands are based upon include the OS 1” First Edition maps, the OS 1:25 000 and the OS 1:50 000 maps. The boundaries cannot be taken as precise, especially where they are surrounded by woodland, and are only precisely comparable with other boundaries at the 1” map scale (1:63 360). The inventory identifies over 22,000 ancient woodland sites in England. Ancient woodland is identified using presence or absence of woods from old maps, information about the wood's name, shape, internal boundaries, location relative to other features, ground survey, and aerial photography. The information recorded about each wood and stored on the Inventory Database includes its grid reference, its area in hectares and how much is semi-natural or replanted. Prior to the digitisation of the boundaries, only paper maps depicting each ancient wood at 1:50 000 scale were available. The datasets consulted: OS MasterMap, OS First Edition Maps (Historic County Series Maps Epoch 1-4), Historic OS Drawings, Aerial Imagery, Original AWI Datasheets, Open Source old historical maps (varies depending on county agreements), BSBI Indicator species data, County Tithe Maps, Forestry Commission National Forest Inventory and Forest Condition Survey. Besides the isolated and modified woodland boundaries derived from OS MasterMap that have been identified Ancient Woodland, additional third party data is viewed for informative purposes only during the creation of the project layer. No data from any other of these third party sources is copied, transferred or viewable in the layer to be published.\"</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Attributes</strong><br />&nbsp;</div><figure style='width:749pt;'><figure style='width:642pt;'><figure><figure><figure><table style='border-collapse:collapse;' width='855' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' border='0'><tbody><tr style='height:19.5pt;' height='26'><td style='height:19.5pt;

            "description": "<p>Location of ponds surveyed as part of Phase 1 of the Natural England 2013 Greated Crested Newt Evidence Enhancement Project (NE GCN EEP Surveyed GIS).Great crested newts (GCN), alongside other species listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive, are afforded particular protection because of their conservation status at a European scale. This species is widespread in Europe, but has declined since the 1940s. In the UK, GCN are widespread and locally common, with a patchy distribution, especially in South West England, parts of Wales, and in Scotland. A requirement of the Habitats Directive of each EU member state is to ensure that European Protected Species are maintained at or restored to ‘favourable conservation status’ across their natural range. In order to better understand the conservation status of the species in England, a much better understanding is needed of the distribution and extent of the population of the species in its natural range, and the habitat available to it. This project forms part of a series of projects to produce an enhanced evidence base which can be used to inform decisions about land-use planning and determining conservation status. It is the first of a two-stage exercise to collect data to develop a model for predicting the presence of GCN. Potential applications of a predictive model could include earlier identification of areas where GCN can be ruled in or out as a concern in land-use planning decisions. Data is a sample of ponds identified in pilot survey locations. Data should subsequently not be used as a definitive indicator of total pond coverage.</p><p style='margin: 12pt 0cm 6pt;'><font color='#000000' face='Arial' size='3'>Full metadata can be viewed on </font><a href='https://data.gov.uk/dataset/b091f2f9-f3c2-4e5e-b1ab-b5fcc6762cad/great-crested-newt-evidence-enhancement-project-2013' target='_blank'>data.gov.uk</a>.</p><p><font color='#000000' size='3'>\n\n</font></p>",
